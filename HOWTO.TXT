In order to have 5.1 sound, basically there are only
two options:
1. Pass-through DTS or AC3. If you have sound already encoded by one
   of these codecs i.e. on DVD/Blu-ray, AND your sound stack supports
   pass-through mode.  Note: it's impossible to mix sounds in this case,
   and PipeWire does not support pass-through at the moment. YouTube does
   not give you 5.1 sound by deault. Also browsers tends to decode DTS
   or AC3 sound instead of passing-through even if it could be possible.
2. Decode anything to 6-channel PCM (if encoded) and pass it (possibly
   through PipeWire or PulseAudio) over HDMI. It SHOULD work. If it
   doesn't -- pass 6-channel sound to this plugin for re-encoding to
   DTS. Note, it means quality loss and relatively high CPU usage. For
   S/PDIF it's the only option if pass-through doesn't work.

How to test HDMI:

    $ speaker-test -c6 -r 48000 -t wav -D hdmi:CARD=PCH,DEV=$X

    Where $X is a number starting from 0 (see `aplay -L`)

    If you don't hear anything, or only Left/Right, or Rear+Front at
    the same time, then your HDMI receiver is broken and is not able
    to play PCM 5.1 sound. If you hear all the channels separately,
    please don't use this plugin, it is useless for you.

    Install the plugin, restart PulseAudio or PipeWire daemons
    (systemctl --user restart XXXX), choose HDMI/DTS in pavucontrol
    and try:

    $ speaker-test -c6

    You should hear each channel separately even on broken HDMI (or
    S/PDIF) receiver.
